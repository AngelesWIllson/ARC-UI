## ARC-UI
A reskinned bedrock's vanilla UI to have controller feelings!

ARC-UI is essentially a reskin of bedrock's vanilla UI to have faithful feelings if minecraft should be a console game. This UI pack is inspired from Valve's source game with steam deck UI

## What's in it?
( Like I said, alpha stage. )
* A full customizable configuration supports (currently implementing)
* Usable controls supports (currently implementing)
* Better visuals and style, better with any resource packs on top of it!
* Keeping Vanilla as possible
* Low-end supports, with pretty decent optimization
* Developed in mobile

## Progress
* Configuration implementations - (ongoing)
* Proper implementations of others - (ongoing)

## Goal of this
* Better interface with controller in mind
* Configurations for customizations, alongside with beginners supports so don't worry if you can't change or do it.
* Making interface more friendly as possible, make it like. how you used to interact games on a tablet or portable devices, or how bedrock was used to be.

## Be warned.
While Arc-UI is a ongoing projects, and it's now "Beta" releases, expect to have couple of issues i.e â€” crashes, lagging, interface doesn't fit into your device screen, poor mobile designs and so on.
This project is created in mobile as it's purpose for controller users in mind, which it includes me. Thus, a only developer on this project. which, it's solo project.
