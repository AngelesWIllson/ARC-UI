> What is this...?
It's a configuration file, pretty optional for use.
You can modify the theme colors, change background,
disable some elements and could slowly transform
into a skin!

> How do i modify?
Edit "config.json", you should see a ton of toggles with
'true' or 'false', or maybe color too.

> How do i apply the config to the UI?
Import the config pack once you finished modifying its
configuration file, apply the pack by putting config pack
on the top of Arcdustry-UI. should be good to go.
